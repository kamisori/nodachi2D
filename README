This is a 2d jump and run game engine. It should be possible to also create a 2d space game and even a 2d eagles eye game, with minor modifications to the initialisation of box2d.



It is neccessary to get Box2D and SFML and install/setup those according to the following instructions:



                                        Box2D
                                        -----
posix:
Put it anywhere you like and create a link to the folder containing the following files/folders:

drwxr-xr-x 5 4096  3. Okt 12:54 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 4096  3. Okt 12:54 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1  191 28. Feb 2010  Box2DConfig.cmake
-rw-r--r-- 1 2249  3. Apr 2010  Box2D.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 5033 29. Mär 2010  CMakeLists.txt
drwxr-xr-x 3 4096  3. Okt 12:54 Collision
drwxr-xr-x 2 4096  3. Okt 12:54 Common
drwxr-xr-x 4 4096  3. Okt 22:23 Dynamics

The link goes to include/Box2D, like so:
include/Box2D -> /home/kamisori/work/Box2D_v2.1.2/Box2D/Box2D/

This way you can very simply switch to a new version of box2d if there should come any.
Or if you plan to modify box2d you can switch between your version and the original one more easily.

windows:
probably it is best to put the folder Box2D containing the following files and folders directly into the include folder:

folders:
Collision
Common
Dynamics

files:
Box2DConfig.cmake
Box2D.h
CMakeLists.txt


                                        SFML

posix:
you need to build it from source, and use --prefix=/usr i think. at least i had some problems when i set it up months ago.
If i remember correctly, the libsfml-*.so must go into /usr/lib, while building from source puts it into /usr/local/lib.

windows:
no idea. try getting the binaries, and probably put it into the project root folder and into the bin/debug and bin/release folders.
